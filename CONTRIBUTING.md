# Welcome to the Production Readiness Checklist! (PRC)

We're making it easier to understand how to improve solutions production readiness, and we'd love to have
your help.

## Licensing

By contributing, you agree to release your contribution under
the terms of the license.

## PRR Versions

The `master` branch is the main branch where development happens.
Releases are not tagged, rather they are reviewed in Pull Requests.

## Pull Requests

Our work flow is a [typical GitHub
flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), where
contributors fork the [production-readiness-review repository](https://github.com/devopsguys/production-readiness-review),
make their changes on branch, and submit a
[Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
(a.k.a. "PR").  Pull requests should usually be targeted at the `master`
branch.

Life will be a lot easier for you (and us) if you follow this pattern
(i.e. fork, named branch, submit PR).  If you use your fork's `master`
branch directly, things can get messy.

Please include a nice description of your changes when you submit your PR;
if we have to read the whole diff to figure out why you're contributing
in the first place, you're less likely to get feedback and have your change
merged in.

In addition to outlining your thought process in the PR's description, please
also try to document it in your commits. We welcome it if every commit has a
description of why you have been doing your changes alongside with your
reasoning why this is a good idea. The messages shall be written in
present-tense and in an imperative style (e.g. "Add feature foobar", not "Added
feature foobar" or "Adding feature foobar"). Lines should be wrapped at 80
characters so people with small screens are able to read the commit messages in
their terminal without any problem.

If you are starting to work on a particular area, feel free to submit a PR
that highlights your work in progress (and note in the PR title that it's
not ready to merge). These early PRs are welcome and will help in getting
visibility for your fix, allow others to comment early on the changes and
also let others know that you are currently working on something.
